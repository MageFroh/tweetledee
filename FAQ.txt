// USE

--- I get the error "verify_credentials connection failure error". What is that?
It generally means that you exceeded the Twitter API rate limits. Please see this page for the Twitter limits. As of version 0.2.8 of Tweetledee, the error message that is displayed when you exceed the Twitter rate limits was changed to "Exceeded Twitter API rate limit".

--- What does the Twitter API limit of "15" mean?
You can access the Twitter API 15 times every 15 minutes for these API resources.

--- What does the Twitter API limit of "180" mean?
You can access the Twitter API 180 times every 15 minutes for these API resources.

--- What happens if I exceed the API limit for my account?
Twitter blocks your access to their API data until the remainder of that 15 minute block of time has elapsed. You will receive an error message if you continue to attempt to retrieve new data during this period.

--- How do I avoid exceeding my limit when I use Tweetledee?
Try caching your Twitter data and polling for new data every X seconds so that you do not exceed the limit that is in place for the API resource that you are using. Serve the cached data to your site's users.
